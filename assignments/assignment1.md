# Assignment 1

## Domains

**1. Birding: recording observations, collaboration with others**
* I started researching birds in my sophomore year of high school as part of Science Olympiad, but it quickly grew into a more personal interest/hobby that I have carried with me to this day through birdwatching. I like to keep track of which birds I've spotted, and I also like to share my birding experiences with others.

**2. Club management: multiple exec functions, (common) scattered organization of tools**
* I am currently the president of the Asymptones at MIT, which requires me to keep track of a lot of different tasks (concert prep, finance budget, social planning, and more). My group's organizational system works well enough for me, although I do sometimes wonder if there are better organizational ways.

**3. Physical therapy: tracking, adjustable reminders needed since I often lose track of time while working**

**4. Job applications: status tracking and categorization have to be made by myself**

**5. Movie watching: personally interested in a variety of genres, have a long watchlist that could use some organization**

**6. Grocery shopping: often buy in bulk to reduce number of trips to the store, shop with recipes in mind**

**7. Communal kitchen cleanliness: have faced clogged sinks, dirty dishes / counters, stovetops left on**

**8. Fashion: popular form of expression for many (including me), multiple established existing styles that can be fun to play around with**

**9. Sleep: struggle with keeping a consistent sleep schedule, many others deprioritize sleep**

**10. Campus events: generally broadcast through dormspam and posters, incredible variety of events but at the same time are easy to get lost in**
* MIT is teeming with a variety of campus events to satisfy different interests and personalities. These events are generally advertised via dormspam and posters. I of course cannot attend all campus events, but it should be safe to assume that these events can also vary widely in terms of attendance. This can be related to how the current advertising works. As a student involved in performance groups, I often consider ways we could improve visibility for our own concerts.

## Problems

### 1. Birding
* Collaborating with other birders: making birding more personable compared to a large database
    - *Selected* 
    - I find birding more fun with others especially considering how slow-paced the activity usually is. Having in-person birding trips with others is able to fulfill that, but I find that there isn't a very good remote equivalent. Existing apps offer ways to keep track of which birds you and others have seen, but the latter is usually at the global scope. I think it would be nice to have an app that can make collaboration more focused, allowing people to have more control over whose bird activity they can follow.
* Assisted creation of checklist of birds: establishing a list of birds spotted for personal entertainment and research help
    - *Not Selected*
    - My original idea was to perhaps have some merging of Merlin Bird ID (which allows for assisted identification through a list of questions) and eBird (where you actually keep track of what birds you have spotted) so that birders wouldn't have to keep flipping between the two apps, but I don't believe this is a big enough concern nor a large enough personal desire of mine to implement.
* Expanding the birding community: lowering the entry barrier to birding, promoting birds especially among younger populations
    - *Selected*
    - It is easy to look out for birds, but it can be more difficult to get into bird identification, which is generally another large part of birdwatching. Existing apps like eBird are able to give a lot of information, but I would personally find that amount of information rather overwhelming and deterring. I would have benefitted from a more beginner-friendly app back when I was first starting out!

### 2. Club management
* Centralizing information: condensing information into one source for easier reference
    - *Not Selected*
    - I have concerns that a highly centralized source of information can just make things more difficult to find. What my group currently does is have different Discord channels within a server to handle different functions; while it does mean I have to shift through channels very frequently, I also don't believe having a single channel to discuss things (which I think would be a bit analogic to an app attempting to solve this problem) would make anything better.
* Task tracking: keeping track of who needs to do what and who still has to / has already done something
    - *Not Selected*
    - By itself, this problem already has a few different effective solutions like Asana and Jira. Creating another app would not be necessary. This could perhaps be paired with another problem into an app, but this then runs the risk of overcomplexity.
* Automated member engagement tracking: attendance analytics and automated warnings
    - *Not Selected*
    - My clubs have our secretary look out for concerning attendance and give warning notices to members as needed, but this can be a bit pesky for our secretary to do since it's a bit more work and also requires some comfort with confrontation. However, I ultimately didn't choose this because I don't know how effective an automated notice would actually be at getting someone to improve their attendance versus an exec member telling them personally.

### 3. Campus events
* Organized event advertising: improve event advertising that is rather scattered / gets lost easily
    - *Selected*
    - MIT event advertising is generally done via emails and postering. While not ineffective, I do I believe it would be nicer to have a separate organizing app for these events to further improve visibility (benefitting the event hosts) and allow for something like event filtering (benefitting those trying to find events based on their interests). 
* Overloading of email inboxes: reduce information overload often leading to sense of overwhelmedness and anxiety
    - *Not Selected*
    - While campus event advertising emails do inflate inboxes, I think that getting rid of campus event advertising emails is also impractical considering the generally universal use of email today. It's also a bit generic of a problem.
* Remembering to attend events: connecting event advertising to actual event attendance follow-through
    - *Not Selected*
    - Forgetting about an event can happen, but I don't believe this problem is concerning enough on its own. People can put down events in their calendars or other similar apps to keep track of events that they wish to attend, and it would also be difficult to come up with something original if an app were to be made.

## Stakeholders

### 1. Collaborating with other birders
* Birding societies: communities dedicated to raising awareness of birds and birding
* Family and friends of birders: family and friends, may accompany birders on their birding trips / have an interest in being involved in something the birder enjoys
* Environmentalists: those with a vested interest in the health of the environment

Members within a birding society can remain connected with each other by having an app that allows you to see each other's achievements compared to just a global database of people's spottings. Family and friends may feel connected to the birder by being able to participate casually with them. Environmentalists could benefit as this can promote greater appreciation for birds and potentially consequently for nature/the environment.

### 2. Expanding the birding community
* Beginner birders: people who are relatively new to birding
* Bird researchers: those who collect data about bird sightings, migration patterns, etc.
* Birding economy: social domain involving production, consumption, and trade of birding-related services (e.g binoculars, tickets for birding trips)

Beginner birders may benefit from a slower-paced app that helps them learn bird species and that does not spring an entire database of birds onto them. Bird researchers would benefit from greater accessibility to more involved birding as there are many resources allowing birders to report their spottings to a global database that subsequently supports ornithological research about things like biogeography/migration. Birding often involves binoculars, field guides, and other resources whose purchases boost the economy.

### 3. Organized event advertising
* Event organizers: those who are putting together the event
* Event audience: those who the event is open to
* Campus event admins: those that manage the registration and monitor the attendance of campus events

Event organizers would gain from an organized system that can help event visibility and attendance. Students and staff would benefit from a more organized way to find events that they are / would be interested in compared to relying primarily on emails (that can easily get lost in inboxes) and posters (that may not be eyecatching since many may be too occupied hustling to classes to really notice). Campus event admins can similarly benefit from such organization to know what events are happening and would assumedly be interested in ways to bolster student work/activities.

## Evidence

### 1. Collaborating with other birders
* [InsideClimateNews](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13122024/todays-climate-birding-economics-outdoor-recreation/) As of 2022, around 96 million people in the United States (more than 35%) were birders. This suggests a decent potential audience should a collaborative birding app be made.
* [eBird News](https://ebird.org/news/2024-year-in-review) In 2024, 11.8 million people used Merlin Bird ID to help identify birds. This was a 40% increase from the previous year, thus showing an increased interest in birding and in the use of birding apps. This suggests a decent potential audience should a collaborative birding app be made.
* [Cornell Chronicle](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/09/birding-buddies-build-social-and-science-communication-skills) Collaborative birding helps people learn social skills in a space where people share a common interest. Having an app to further encourage that thus can help people beyond improved birding.
* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/07/birdwatching-changes-the-way-you-look-at-the-world-it-truly-is-the-gateway-drug-to-environmental-awareness) Increasing bird awareness/knowledge can promote people's roles in the environment from observers to advocates.
* [IntoBirds](https://intobirds.com/use-caution-when-posting-bird-sightings-over-social-media/) There have been warnings on sharing precise locations of birds so as not to cause overcrowding of tourists/birdwatchers or alert bird hunters. While not an entire deterrent to developing a collaborative birding app, this would certainly be something that needs to be considered.
* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/24/birding-online-community-10000-species) There is some concern over the validity of bird tracking done on apps. Platforms like eBird do have measures to resolve this such as moderators, but this would be a larger scope than perhaps feasible for a class project. Even if feasible, there would be the question of whether moderators should have access to birding groups (privacy issue?).
* [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) eBird is a widely popular app for searching up bird species and submitting bird spottings. It's incredibly effective as a database and for citizen data science collection but doesn't seem to have a feature where you can narrow your collaborative birding scope from global.
* [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) Merlin is very good for birders who may need some help identifying a bird that they've seen or heard outside. However, like eBird, it doesn't seem to have an option to create focused birding groups.
* [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) iNaturalist allows users to track species that they've spotted and share that with specific people. However, it is not limited to birds.
* [Audubon](https://www.audubon.org/bird-guide) Audubon is a highly trusted field guide for birds. However, its usage is more exploratory and better for research than for birders that are more interested in identification and tracking.

### 2. Expanding the birding community
* [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494424000793) Birding has been linked to improved mental health. Promoting the hobby can thus consequently spread this health benefit.
* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/07/birdwatching-changes-the-way-you-look-at-the-world-it-truly-is-the-gateway-drug-to-environmental-awareness) Increasing bird awareness/knowledge can promote people's roles in the environment from observers to advocates.
* [Wild Bird Feeding Institute](https://www.wbfi.org/2023/06/20/how-citizen-scientists-are-revolutionizing-avian-research/) Citizens contributing data online helps researchers better understand and preserve bird populations, migration patterns, etc. Expanding the birding community can further aid in this research.
* [InsideClimateNews](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13122024/todays-climate-birding-economics-outdoor-recreation/) In 2022, birders spent around $107.6 billion for their birding pursuits. This is quite an impressive amount of revenue!
* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/26/social-media-posts-endangered-species-capercaillie-birders-aoe) There are rules set in place to protect bird species, but birders and nature photographers have not always adhered to these properly. For instance, in 2022, a birdwatcher was found distrubing capercaillie in Scotland despite it being illegal to distrub them during their breeding season. Expanding the birding community could worsen this issue.
* [Audubon](https://www.audubon.org/bird-guide) As said above, Audubon is a highly trusted field guide for birds. However, its usage is likely better suited for knowledgable birders that know what to search for compared to birders that are still starting out.
* [Bird Academy](https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/) Established by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Bird Academy offers a variety of different courses designed to help people become better birders. It could potentially be a bit deterring for those who want a more casual learn compared to paying money for a course. New birders may also benefit from introductions that are catered to their local location (learning with birds known to live around them) versus a more general course.
* [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) As said above, Merlin is very good for birders who may need some help identifying a bird that they've seen or heard outside. This makes it a very helpful resource for those who are learning how to identify birds, but it has less focus on actually guiding new birders with tips on how to identify/distinguish birds.
* [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) As said above, eBird is a widely popular app for searching up bird species and submitting bird spottings. However, I would not say it is the most useful for those who are starting out with birding and do not have sufficient bird identification knowledge to use the app effectively.
* [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) As said above, iNaturalist allows users to track species that they've spotted and share that with specific people. However, it is not limited to birds.

### 3. Organized event advertising
* [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/2025/01/17/students-feel-spammed-overload-university-emails) A study found that students feel that they receive too many university emails, leading to some disengaging from their emails and consequently missing out on the emails they would actually be interested in. This would suggest that another avenue for organizing and advertising emails online could be helpful.
* [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/college-experience/2023/10/31/reaching-college-students-campus-event-news) A Fall 2023 Student Voice survey found that 30% of students do not participate in extracurriculars with a primary reason being students' lack of awareness of such events/activities due to insufficient advertising. While the survey is not specific to MIT students, it would not be unreasonable to assume a similar situation for MIT. Speaking from personal experience, I similarly believe that I often miss out on campus events because the current advertising system is too much for me to read through entirely.
* [The Ohio State University](https://cssl.osu.edu/research-projects/involvement-study) Campus involvement has many related benefits, including better grades and multicultural awareness, thus making campus event advertising a worthy endeavor for student health.
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload) Information overload refers to greater confusion and indecision caused by having too much information about an issue. Connecting back to campus events, creating another resource to better filter events can reduce the amount of information being presented but could also have difficulty being adopted as it ultimately still does mean yet another source of information that students may be disengaged from searching for.
* [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/choice-overload-bias) When presented with many options, people may experience heightened anxiety that stunts their decision making and that can consequently cause post-choice regret from choosing one choice over another or not making a choice at all. This could suggest that a better event filtering system could help make decisions more streamline by presenting less choices that are also more relevant to the particular user.
* [eSchoolNews](https://www.eschoolnews.com/digital-learning/2025/04/28/too-many-apps-for-that-in-schools/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Having multiple apps/websites can be dissatisfying from an administrative perspective (e.g having to make modifications in multiple places versus one) and for regular users (having to look at yet another app for information on top of the other apps that already exist). A solution could be to make a new app that entirely replaces the current apps that are being used instead of just having the app be a supplemental resource, but this would be a bigger initiative.
* [Raftr](https://www.raftr.com/mobile-first-student-engagement-in-higher-education/) Raftr is a student engagement platform that uses mobile text notifications to broadcast campus events. Its creation was supported by a 2024 EDUCAUSE Student Technology Report showing that 72% of students preferred mobile notifications over email. Raftr does well to adapt to the trends of the new student generation, but a deluge of mobile text notifications can ultimately have the same deterring effect as overloading email inboxes.
* [Facebook Events](https://www.facebook.com/events/) Facebook Events is a place where people can advertise events. However, this displays all events that are not necessarily MIT-affiliated. There does not seem to be a MIT-dedicated page.
* [Engage](https://engage.mit.edu/) Engage is a platform where students can find events and also manage their clubs. Events can be categorized, but the events it advertises do not seem to encompass all events that are normally advertised on dormspam. Engage also generally seems to be used more for club management than for event finding.
* [MIT Calendar](https://calendar.mit.edu/) The MIT calendar displays different events that the MIT community can attend. However, the calendar appears to be for larger events like presentations and sports games whereas dormspam often includes events like parties, club auditions, and more. 

## Features

### 1. Collaborating with other birders
* **Private Birding Groups**
    - You can create a birding group with friends/family/others of your choosing. Within the group, you can view each other's stats (that can include what birds people have spotted) and chat with one another. This makes birding a bit more personable compared to just contributing to a global database in which you cannot really become closer with anyone, and it's a step up from regular messaging group chats that wouldn't be able to report birding stats.
* **Birding Collaboration Challenges**
    - Creating small challenges adds a game aspect to birding that can be fun to accomplish with others. These challenges could be something broad like finding 10 different species of ducks or trying to find a particular bird species. These challenges foster teamwork and can bring a good sense of joy/accomplishment when completed.
* **Birding Trip Organizer**
    - This feature could involve a built-in availability scheduler and a recommendation of local birding spots (integration with Google Maps? Recommendations from other users of the app, with the reporter being made anonymous for privacy? This is open to flexibilty) within the app. This could be done by using something like Schej and Google Maps combined, but combining these two features to remove the need to use two resources could make things more efficient.

### 2. Expanding the birding community
* **Gamified Birding**
    - Creating small challenges adds a game aspect to birding that can be fun and encourage new birders to continue with the hobby. It adds a bit of extra guided energy to a relatively slow-paced hobby that may not always intrigue people immediately (I personally found birding rather boring at first).
* **Locally-Focused Birding Tutorials**
    - Birding tutorials exist, but they tend to be broad or very dense. Having smaller tutorials with birds known to be popular near where the user is can limit the scope of birding and make the entry barrier less intimidating. Teaching with local birds also helps make knowledge more quickly applicable, and new birders who succeed in identifying a bird could feel a sense of accomplishment that encourages them to stay with the hobby.
* **Birding Mentorship**
    - Birders wishing for extra guidance can search for more experienced birders that are willing to guide them, whether in bird identification, birding tips, and/or something else. There are many birding forums and other resources available already, but a mentorship can provide more personalization.

### 3. Organized event advertising
* **Personalized Event Recommendations**
    - Based on the user's event attendance history, this feature will recommend similar events that the user may be interested in. This would help people find events believed to be more relevant to their interests. From the implementation perspective, campus administration often requires an attendance count, so pairing this feature with this attendance track could be feasible.
* **Colorized Event Calendar**
    - Events are displayed on a calendar and categorized (with color) by their type. Users can then look for events by their color; this would be like a more visual way to searching for events by type to improve relevance searches. This feature could be paired with calendar customization where event types can be hidden upon the user's request based on what they would like to see.
* **Location-Focused Event Finding**
    - Users looking for an event can use this feature to find events that are or will be happening nearby. This can be especially helpful for those who are not willing to travel far. This would provide some uniqueness from the regular filters that usually categorize events by their type (e.g academic, performing).
